### Tarlac, Adept Crafter

- Hoping to become adept at crafting programs.
- Mainly work in C/C++ and Python for work.
- Hobby projects have used C#, Python, C++, Java, Windows Batch, Bash, 
  and Lua, from most to least used.

### About Me

I love playing video games and I also host and manage game servers for my 
friends. I publish scripts and programs that make it easier to manage servers 
and games that I play. Hopefully these tools can help others as well!

Learn more about me at [my website](https://tarlac-adept-crafter.github.io)! (once I actually make it...)

### Why Adept Crafter?

- I reached the Adept Crafter rank in Wizard101 one time.
- My crafting level in Runescape is also pretty high.
